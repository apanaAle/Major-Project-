This study analyzes antenatal care (ANC) utilization and the socioeconomic disparities influencing maternal health service access among pregnant women in Nepal using data from the 2022 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). 
Despite progress in maternal healthcare, significant inequalities persist due to factors such as education, wealth status, geographic location, and ethnicity.
A composite health access indicator was constructed by recode and categorizing key ANC variables, which allowed for the quantification of care received across four major domains: service utilization and timing, medical interventions, care provider and location, and quality of support.
Using hierarchical clustering, two distinct groups of women emerged: those with “Good Maternal Care” and those with “Low Maternal Care.” Cross-tabulation and chi-square analyses revealed statistically significant associations between ANC uptake and independent variables such as maternal education, household wealth, ethnicity, and province of residence.
To further uncover predictive patterns, machine learning algorithms particularly XG-Boost were employed, achieving a classification accuracy of 88%. Permutation testing highlighted cluster number, district, and maternal education level as the most influential predictors of ANC access.
These findings reflect the multidimensional nature of inequality in maternal health and point to the need for geographically and socially targeted policy interventions.
By combining traditional statistical techniques with advanced data-driven methods, this study offers a robust understanding of maternal healthcare disparities in Nepal. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted, equity-focused interventions to bridge existing gaps and improve maternal health outcomes in Nepal, particularly for marginalized and underserved populations.
